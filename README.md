BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE & NEUROTECHNOLOGY: https://www.gtec.at/
Invasive and non-invasive stimulation and brain mapping techniques are used to determine brain functions in neuroscience, rehabilitation research and neurosurgery. 
g.tec’s electrical stimulators help you to understand cortical functions and perform brain-mapping experiments with a closed-loop system.
High-density EEG, EMG, and ECG recordings offer unparalleled precision and detail for capturing bioelectrical signals from the brain, muscles, and heart. 
By utilizing a dense array of electrodes, these systems provide high spatial resolution, enabling researchers and clinicians to map activity with exceptional accuracy.

Attenuation of High Gamma Activity by Repetitive Motor Tasks
High gamma activity (HGA) is a crucial biomarker for functional brain mapping, particularly in sensorimotor areas, to preserve functionality after brain surgeries. 
HGA mapping paradigms typically involve multiple task blocks alternating with resting (R) conditions, where each block comprises consecutive tasks under nonresting (NR) conditions. Howev...
